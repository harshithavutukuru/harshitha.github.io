The project titled Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning aims to build a predictive model to estimate the prices of used cars based on various features like make, model, mileage, year of manufacture, fuel type, and more. 
This model is designed to assist both buyers and sellers in determining a fair market value for used vehicles, streamlining the process of buying and selling in the used car market.



Key Highlights:
Objective: The goal of this project is to apply machine learning algorithms to predict car prices based on historical data and various vehicle features, helping users accurately assess a car's value.
Dataset: The dataset, sourced from a reputable car sales platform, includes features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and engine size. Missing values were handled, and categorical variables were processed using one-hot encoding.
Algorithms:
Random Forest Regression: The model uses hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. The accuracy and results are evaluated using residuals and visualized through scatter plots and histograms.
Linear Regression: A simpler and interpretable model is also implemented, with accuracy tested and compared to Random Forest results.
Training & Testing: The dataset was split into 85% training and 15% testing data, ensuring consistent evaluation across multiple runs.
Feature Selection: The importance of features like "Present Price," "Kms Driven," and "Owner" was assessed to understand their contribution to the prediction model.



Results:
Both models were evaluated for accuracy, and their performance was compared. The project highlights the advantages of Random Forest Regression due to its flexibility and voting mechanism, while Linear Regression was noted for its simplicity.

This project provides an effective framework for predicting car prices, with potential applications in real-world car sales platforms.
